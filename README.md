# \Introduction to Python\
Data analysis is a broad term that covers a wide range of techniques that enable revealing any insights and relationships that may exist within raw data. As might be expected, Python lends itself readily to data analysis. Once Python has analyzed the data, findings can then be used to make good business decisions, improve procedures, and even make informed predictions based on what has been discovered.
# Variable
A variable is a storage location (in a computer's memory) for holding a value of a specific data type.
