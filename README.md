# Introduction to Python
Data analysis is a broad term that covers a wide range of techniques that enable revealing any insights and relationships that may exist within raw data. As might be expected, Python lends itself readily to data analysis. Once Python has analyzed the data, findings can then be used to make good business decisions, improve procedures, and even make informed predictions based on what has been discovered.
# Variable
A variable is a storage location (in a computer's memory) for holding a value of a specific data type.

# Data Type (1)
The built-in data types in Python include three main categories::
1. Numbers
2. Strings
3. Booleans
## Numbers
In Pyhthon the numeric data type "numbers" is divided into three: 
1. integer 
2. float
3. complex

> The difference between the integer data type and float is the presence of decimal points.

> The value of a complex number is written in the form x+yj, where x is a real number and yj is an imaginary number
## String
A string is a sequence of Unicode characters declared with single or double quotes. Multi-line strings can be indicated by three single quotes ('''), double quotes ("""), or \n.

## Boolean
The Boolean data type, or Bool, is a subtype of integers that only has two constant values: True or False.
